          <h2>What do we mean by escapism?</h2>
          <p>
            Escapism is the avoidance of reality by absorption of the mind in
            entertainment. In other words, it would be defined as the tendency
            to seek distraction fro unpleasant realities. It has been proven
            to be a good of way managing stress by offering a way to take the
            pressure off and temporarily disconnect.It can provide enough
            space and distance to enjoy the present moment, a welcome relief
            when life’s getting on top of you. Escapism can form from reading
            a book to traveling to a new place, but the one we propose is a
            relaxation with breathing exercises and music to calm your mind.
            Our goal is to make you feel free and ready to face any obstacle
            you may be facing. Our imaginations can be a wonderful thing for
            alleviating stress. It offers us time and space to better deal
            with our problems. No one understands your mental health better
            than you, with some time with yourself you might find a way to
            make your life more enjoyable.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph right">
          <h2>Benefits</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Relieve pressure</li>
            <li>Take a step back from a stressful day</li>
            <li>Free your mind</li>
            <li>
              Breath out all the stress, anger and pain that you are carrying
              on you back
            </li>
            <li>Recharge your physical and mental batteries</li>
            <li>Snap out of your emotions when you feel overwhelmed</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While escapism might not be the solution to life's big problems,
            it might give you the step you need to look at your problem from a
            different approach. It will surely make you more positive.

        <h2>Daily activity schedule</h2>
        <p>
          It is true that most of us are quite busy with Everythingwe have to
          do in our day, the assignments, revisions, projects and jobs. But
          meditation is a form of mind training that is quite hard to get used
          to, that is why we have this shedule because the goal is making a
          habit of escapism. However, at the beginning if you are able to do
          even one of these sessions per day you are already putting the
          effort and that is what matters the most. For each meditation
          session there will be the steps you can follow and put music either
          your own or our playlist or you can just watch the video that we
          have selcted from youtube for you. The first sessions might not have
          a direct effect, but after a few days or weeks you will surely see
          the difference, so take the first step.

          <div class="content">
            <h3 class="underlined">Explanation</h3>
            <p>
              This Session is the first you have to do in a day and it is
              pretty effective to prepare you for the daily stress. The
              morning is one of the most important moments in the day because
              your attitude and energy at that time will determine how your
              day will be, as the saying "get up on the wrong side of the bed"
              highlights it, your morning routing will determine how you will
              feel for the rest of the day.This session is supposed to be
              about 10 min but of course you can do it for how long as you
              want, we promise it will have a positive effect on your day.
            </p>
            <h3 class="underlined">Preparation</h3>
            <p>
              When getting up in the morning, get yoruself a pillow or a mat,
              choose a place where you feel calm and relaxed and sit on the
              floor crossed legs, make yoruself comfortable but try to keep
              your back straight. You can take your morning coffee first but
              it is better if it right after you wake up.
            </p>
            <h3 class="underlined">Steps</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                (optional) Put on your earphones with a music without lyrics,
                preferably something happy but not too catchy so that you can
                keep your motication. Or play our playlist on the right.
              </li>
              <li>
                Take a deep breath and close your eyes gently and focus on the
                music you are listening or on the sounds around you
              </li>
              <li>Inhale and exhale deeply for about 1 minute</li>
              <li>
                Scan your body from the feet to the head and try to notice any
                sensations, ask your body "how are you?". And if you feel any
                tension anywhere just focus your breath on that point when you
                inhale
              </li>
              <li>
                Let your mind wander, we all have a lot of toughts and things
                to remember on a daily basis, let all of the ones that are
                already there come up in your mind without jugement without
                stressing about them. Let those thought pass in your head like
                clouds moves in the sky, you are just an observer of those
                thoughs even the negative ones.
              </li>
              <li>
                While your mind is wandering, you might lose focus and start
                being stressed and judgemental about your thoughts again. A
                simple way to keep that from happening is direct the focus on
                your breath, keep breathing seeply at a constant rate. When
                you focus on it, your heart will slow down, you mind will
                quiet down and your body starts to relax
              </li>
              <li>
                when you feel like you are done and your mind feels relaxed,
                or the time you have set is over. Open your eyes gently while
                focusing on your breath, make it come back to normal slowly
                and then strech your body a little bit.
              </li>
              <li>
                You are now ready for the day with a foucsed mind and a
                relaxed body, there is no better combination
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="underlined">Video</h3>
            <p>
              A video from the youtube chanel "Boho Beautiful Yoga" that is
              very helpful and quite effective to relax.

            <p>
              You have gone through a fair part of your day and a fair part of
              stress, it's time for the second session. It can be at any time
              between while you at work, you can even do it multiple times if
              you need, it will just take around 5 minutes of your time to
              relax and reset your mind and body to go through the day. The
              workplace and school are two sources of intense stress and
              anxiety, in this case escapism can help you make better
              decision.

              This session is taking place right after work to release all the
              stress of the day and reconnect with yourself after all this
              anxiety and stress. You can do it when you arrive at home or

              minutes.
            </p>
            <h3 class="underlined">Preparation</h3>
            <p>

              work, in your car, at home, in the school bus, in school,... You

              you want to.
            </p>
            <h3 class="underlined">Steps</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                (optional) Put on your earphones with a music without lyrics,

              <li>
                Breath deeply, feel the movement of your chest as you inhale
                and exhale. Move your head, up and down, left and right as you
                breath to relax your neck muscles that keep the tension of
                your stress of the entire day.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can stop moving your head.Now breath in for 4 seconds and
                breath out for 4 seconds, do this 5 times.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you lose focus, it is not a problem, acknowledge it and
                come back to the exercise, it will even improve your focus
              </li>
              <li>
                Now think about all the stress you have experienced during the
                day, all the problems and frustrations that you have
                experienced, imagine it as a ball in your stomach that makes
                you feel uncomfortable. With every exhales the ball loses
                weight and size.
              </li>
              <li>
                You breath in energy and breath out all the unresolved
                problems. You breath in joy and breath out stress.
              </li>
              <li>
                The ball is not in your stomach anymore, and you feel free.
                Now stretch your arms up above your head and open your
                fingers, push as far as possible, move your shoulder back and
                forth.
              </li>

            <p>
              And finally the last session of the day, right before sleeping
              after watching the TV, showering,... You are refreshed and this
              meditation is to prepare you for a high quality sleep. The goal
              is to let go everything painful or joyful, and disconnect with
              the world and get into a completely relaxed mindfulness. This
              session will be a around 10 min and will help improve the
              quality of your sleep.

            <h3 class="underlined">Preparation</h3>
            <p>
              Find some peaceful place next to your bed where you can
              comfortably sit down on the floor, preferably on a pillow or a
              mattress to not hurt your back. Make sure that you do not have
              anything to do anymore apart from going to bed
            </p>
            <h3 class="underlined">Steps</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                (optional) Put on your earphones with a music without lyrics,
                preferably something happy but not too catchy so that you can
                keep your notification. Or play our playlist on the right.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sit down on the floor with your back straight and start
                breathing deeply
              </li>
              <li>
                When you feel like your body and your breathing have
                synchronized, scan your mind and let all your thoughts come up
              </li>
              <li>
                Visualize yourself sitting beside a gently floating stream,
                next to you there is a big tree full of leaves and those
                leaves are all your thoughts. Put as many details possible,
                from the colors to the presence of fishes in the water.
              </li>
              <li>
                Now imagine that each leaf falls on the lake, assign a thought
                to that leaf either joyful, painful or neutral and watch them
                float down the river. Even the "I don't have a thought" though
                should go on a leaf
              </li>
              <li>
                When you realize that you don't have any thoughts left to put
                on the leaf, watch the stream flow at its own pace, calm and
                peaceful.
              </li>
              <li>
                Notice the urge to rush the flow and resist it, you don't need
                to rush any thoughts or get ride of them. Accept them as they
                come and go.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a thought comes by multiple times, watch it float as many
                times as you need to, any thought you are having even about
                the exercise, place on a leaf and let it go
              </li>
              <li>
                Now that all the leaves have fallen from the tree and they
                have gone with the stream, watch the empty stream and focus on
                its pace
              </li>
              <li>
                Gently return your awareness and prepare yourself to go to
                sleep without losing that freedom of mind, do not let thoughts
                come back, they have float down the stream and have left.
              </li>
            </ul>
