          <h2>What do we mean by escapism?</h2>
          <p>
            Escapism is the avoidance of reality by absorption of the mind in
            enternainement. In other words, it would be defined as the tendency
            to seek distraction fro unpleasant realities. It has been proven to
            be a good of way managing stress by offering a way to take the
            pressure off and temporarily disconnect.It can provide enough space
            and distance to enjoy the present moment, a welcome relief when
            lifeâ€™s getting on top of you. Escapism can form from reading a book
            to traveling to a new place, but the one we propose is a relaxation
            with breathing exercises and music to calm your mind. Our goal is to
            make you feel free and ready to face any obstacle you may be facing.
            Our imaginations can be a wonderful thing for alleviating stress. It
            offers us time and space to better deal with our problems. No one
            understands your mental health better than you, with some time with
            yoruself you might find a way to make your life more enjoyable.
