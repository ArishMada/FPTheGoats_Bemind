            <h2>What do we mean by escapism?</h2>
            <p>
              Escapism is the avoidance of reality by absorption of the mind in
              enternainement. In other words, it would be defined as the
              tendency to seek distraction fro unpleasant realities. It has been
              proven to be a good of way managing stress by offering a way to
              take the pressure off and temporarily disconnect.It can provide
              enough space and distance to enjoy the present moment, a welcome
              relief when lifeâ€™s getting on top of you. Escapism can form from
              reading a book to traveling to a new place, but the one we propose
              is a relaxation with breathing exercises and music to calm your
              mind. Our goal is to make you feel free and ready to face any
              obstacle you may be facing. Our imaginations can be a wonderful
              thing for alleviating stress. It offers us time and space to
              better deal with our problems. No one understands your mental
              health better than you, with some time with yoruself you might
              find a way to make your life more enjoyable.

          <h2>The importance of sleep</h2>
          <p>
            Sleep is as important to our bodies as eating and breathing.
            Sleeping well is essential to your wellbeing, and getting back to a
            well organized sleep schedule could be the first step of healing
            from mental problems. Do not listen to people telling you to get out
            of bed and pull yoruself together, disturb sleep is a part of mental
            illness and in most cases it worsens it. Often changes in your daily
            life habbits are enough to improve the quality of your sleep, that
            is why we want to introduce you to some simple relaxation exercises
            that can also help you for your sleeping problems.

        <h2>Daily acitivity schedule</h2>
        <p>
          It is true that most of us are quite busy with Everythingwe have to do
          in our day, the assignments, revisions, projects and jobs. But
          meditation is a form of mind training that is quite hard to get used
          to, that is why we have this shedule because the goal is making a
          habit of escapism. However, at the beginning if you are able to do
          even one of these sessions per day you are already putting the effort
          and that is what matters the most. For each meditation session there
          will be the steps you can follow and put music either your own or our
          playlist or you can just watch the video that we have selcted from
          youtube for you. The first sessions might not have a direct effect,
          but after a few days or weeks you will surely see the difference, so
          take the first step.

          <div class="content">
            <h3 class="underlined">Explanation</h3>
            <p>
              This Session is the first you have to do in a day and it is pretty
              effective to prepare you for the daily stress. The morning is one
              of the most important moments in the day because your attitude and
              energy at that time will determine how your day will be, as the
              saying "get up on the wrong side of the bed" highlights it, your
              morning routing will determine how you will feel for the rest of
              the day.This session is supposed to be about 10 min but of course
              you can do it for how long as you want, we promise it will have a
              positive effect on your day.
            </p>
            <h3 class="underlined">Preparation</h3>
            <p>
              When getting up in the morning, get yoruself a pillow or a mat,
              choose a place where you feel calm and relaxed and sit on the
              floor crossed legs, make yoruself comfortable but try to keep your
              back straight. You can take your morning coffee first but it is
              better if it right after you wake up.
            </p>
            <h3 class="underlined">Steps</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                (optional) Put on your earphones with a music without lyrics,
                preferably something happy but not too catchy so that you can
                keep your motication. Or play our playlist on the right.
              </li>
              <li>
                Take a deep breath and close your eyes gently and focus on the
                music you are listening or on the sounds around you
              </li>
              <li>Inhale and exhale deeply for about 1 minute</li>
              <li>
                Scan your body from the feet to the head and try to notice any
                sensations, ask your body "how are you?". And if you feel any
                tension anywhere just focus your breath on that point when you
                inhale
              </li>
              <li>
                Let your mind wander, we all have a lot of toughts and things to
                remember on a daily basis, let all of the ones that are already
                there come up in your mind without jugement without stressing
                about them. Let those thought pass in your head like clouds
                moves in the sky, you are just an observer of those thoughs even
                the negative ones.
              </li>
              <li>
                While your mind is wandering, you might lose focus and start
                being stressed and judgemental about your thoughts again. A
                simple way to keep that from happening is direct the focus on
                your breath, keep breathing seeply at a constant rate. When you
                focus on it, your heart will slow down, you mind will quiet down
                and your body starts to relax
              </li>
              <li>
                when you feel like you are done and your mind feels relaxed, or
                the time you have set is over. Open your eyes gently while
                focusing on your breath, make it come back to normal slowly and
                then strech your body a little bit.
              </li>
              <li>
                You are now ready for the day with a foucsed mind and a relaxed
                body, there is no better combination
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="underlined">Video</h3>
            <p>
              A video from the youtube chanel "Boho Beautiful Yoga" that is very
              helpful and quite effective to relax.
