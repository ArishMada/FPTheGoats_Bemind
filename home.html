          Meeting new ppeople can be good for your mental health, it can get
          you out of that bubble of loneliness you create around yourself when
          you start feeling down. Although, it's hard to get back into the
          real world and start socializing again after cutting everyone out.
          But don't worry, Bemind is here to help you meet new people that had
          or are having the same experience as you, you could join a group to
          talk about your problems. And that's not all of it; events will also
          be organized to help the poor, better the environment or just have
          fun. Hope you'll enjoy.
