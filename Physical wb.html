          <h1>The relation between your mind and your body</h1>
          <p>
            It might be counter intuitive to think of a direct relation between
            your physical and mental well-being, but working out can actually
            reduce the risk of developing mental illness. It also help improving
            self-esteem, improving memory, helps you sleep better, and boosts
            your overall mood. When doing some exercise, the brain releases
            chemicals that help improve the mood which help a lot for depression
            and anxiety. Exercise is a powerful depression fighter for several
            reasons. Most importantly, it promotes all kinds of changes in the
            brain, including neural growth, reduced inflammation, and new
            activity patterns that promote feelings of calm and well-being. It
            also releases endorphins, powerful chemicals in your brain that
            energize your spirits and make you feel good. Finally, exercise can
            also serve as a distraction, allowing you to find some quiet time to
            break out of the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression.
