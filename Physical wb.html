        <h1>The relation between your mind and your body</h1>
        <p>
          It might be counter intuitive to think of a direct relation between
          your physical and mental well-being, but working out can actually
          reduce the risk of developing mental illness. It also help improving
          self-esteem, improving memory, helps you sleep better, and boosts
          your overall mood. When doing some exercise, the brain releases
          chemicals that help improve the mood which help a lot for depression
          and anxiety. Exercise is a powerful depression fighter for several
          reasons. Most importantly, it promotes all kinds of changes in the
          brain, including neural growth, reduced inflammation, and new
          activity patterns that promote feelings of calm and well-being. It
          also releases endorphins, powerful chemicals in your brain that
          energize your spirits and make you feel good. Finally, exercise can
          also serve as a distraction, allowing you to find some quiet time to
          break out of the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression.

            <p> Running is a fantastic activity to reduce stress, build endurance and be fit. You do not have to start
              with 10km, actually focusing on the time instead of a distance is more effective. At the beginning you
              could start with as little as 15minutes per day, and you can increase gradually by 5 minutes as you feel
              like it's getting easier. The best for you would be to run more than 40 minutes per day.</p>
